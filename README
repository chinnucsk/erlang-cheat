 Erlang Cheat
-=================-
erlang-cheat is a client side interface to Cheat Sheets on http://cheat.errtheblog.com .

Usage:
---------------------------
Install in a location on the erlang code path.
Usually this is where the other libs are but it can be relocated with some path changes. (see google).

This implementation shares the same cache as the ruby version. The cache is in ~/.cheat
so if cheat files are pulled by erlang-cheat, they should be readable by
the ruby version as well and avoid extra hits on the source server.

Start Cheating!
---------------------------
Once installed somewhere in the erlang code path,
enter the shell and you can do fun stuff like this.

Learning git?
  cheat:sheet(git).

Looking for love?
  cheat:sheet(girlfriend).

Feeling heavy?
  cheat:sheet(loose_weight).  % Yeah, loose should be lose - not my call.

Need to talk to Johnny Law?
  cheat:sheet(police).

Like using ratpoison?
  cheat:sheet(ratpoison).

Need some lorem text:
  cheat:sheet(lorem).

See what's available:
  cheat:recent().
  cheat:all().

Remove an old sheet:
  cheat:remove_sheet(git).

Re-acquire a sheet from the source:
  cheat:sheet_reset(git).
